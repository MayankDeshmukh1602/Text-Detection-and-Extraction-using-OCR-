Text Detection and Extraction using OCR
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on automatic text detection and extraction from images and scanned documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. The system is designed to identify text regions within an image and convert them into machine-readable and editable text formats. It aims to reduce manual data entry, improve document digitization, and enhance text accessibility.
